Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Sting Free: The Compliance & Awareness Nexus
I. Product Overview and Strategic Vision
1.1. Introduction to Sting Free: The Compliance & Awareness Nexus
Sting Free is conceived as a specialized B2B SaaS mobile application engineered to mitigate regulatory and operational risks within the hospitality sector, specifically targeting bars and restaurants. The platform’s core functionality merges a proprietary Learning Management System (LMS) focused on advanced compliance with an operational intelligence layer that provides venues with centralized, near-real-time data regarding regulatory enforcement activities and high-risk internal incidents. This system is designed to transform reactive compliance measures into a proactive risk-prevention strategy.
1.2. Problem Statement: The Cost of Compliance Failure and Information Gaps
Hospitality venues face severe penalties for failing regulatory audits and sting operations. These penalties often include significant fines, temporary or permanent suspension of liquor licenses, and mandated retraining of staff. The financial and reputational damages stemming from such failures are substantial. Furthermore, while established training programs like TIPS address basic responsible alcohol service, they often do not provide mechanisms for real-time operational feedback or tools to address continuous, insidious internal risks, such as employee theft and fraud. Common bartender scams, including "overpouring" or the practice known as the "slam dunk" (pocketing cash payments for well drinks or draft beer without ringing them up), represent significant, hidden revenue loss that traditional compliance platforms overlook.
A critical deficiency in the current market lies in the information lag. Venue operators frequently learn about regulatory activity (e.g., successful underage decoy stings) days or weeks after the event has occurred, preventing timely adjustments to training or operational procedures. Existing LMS platforms effectively track course progress but fail to connect training metrics directly to a reduction in real-world incidents, making it difficult for management to quantify the Return on Investment (ROI) of compliance efforts. Therefore, the Sting Free application is positioned to address this dual failure point: it must function as both a compliance safeguard against external regulatory threats and a specialized loss prevention tool against internal operational fraud to justify its essential B2B subscription pricing.
1.3. Sting Free Value Proposition and Differentiation
Sting Free differentiates itself by shifting the focus from generalized training to actionable, localized, and measurable intelligence designed to reduce both regulatory liability and operational loss.
| Feature Category | Traditional TIPS/LMS | Sting Free App (Proposed) | Differentiation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Regulatory Training | Comprehensive curriculum, legal focus | Modular, proprietary "Sting Certified" content, micro-learning modules | Increased relevance to localized risks, measurable training impact  |
| Management Access | LMS platform for tracking progress | Mobile Dashboard, Real-time staff status, violation tracking, data visualization  | On-the-go operational control and rapid data interpretation |
| Incident Awareness | Reactive; requires manual review of public reports | Proactive/Reactive; Geofenced push notifications (post-incident), Sting History log | Near-real-time, legally defensible operational intelligence  |
| Internal Theft/Scam | Indirect coverage in generic policy | Explicit training modules + Staff reporting mechanisms for scams and internal issues | Directly targets employee fraud and continuous internal risks |
1.4. Business Model and Target User Segments
The Sting Free platform will utilize a subscription-based B2B SaaS model. Pricing will be tiered, determined by the individual venue location and scaled based on the volume of managed staff accounts and access to premium regulatory analysis modules.
The primary user segments are:
 * Venue Owner/General Manager (Admin): This segment requires advanced access to the system, including the Alert Dashboard, compliance history records, staff certification status tracking, and critical configuration tools such as geofence setting and staff roster management.
 * Staff (Bartenders, Servers): This segment interacts primarily with the Training Modules, integrated scenario-based quizzes, individual "Sting Certified" status display, and the essential Quick Incident Report feature, designed for rapid field use.
II. Functional Requirements: The Compliance and Certification Suite
This suite is the foundation of Sting Free, transforming standard alcohol server training into a verifiable, risk-mitigating certification platform.
2.1. Venue Onboarding and Manager Dashboard Requirements
The initial B2B signup process must be designed to minimize user drop-off while securing essential operational data required for service delivery. The onboarding sequence requires the Manager to input foundational information such as the Venue Name, associated Legal Entity ID, the specific physical address (which is essential for subsequent geofencing calculations), Manager Contact details, and Subscription/Payment verification. Successful completion of this flow must redirect the Manager immediately to their centralized mobile dashboard, serving as the system's entry point for operational oversight.
Managers must possess robust capabilities for Staff Roster Management, allowing them to bulk-upload employee details or individually invite staff members to the platform. Staff accounts must be strictly linked to the registered venue, ensuring accurate and granular tracking of compliance status and performance metrics.
The Mobile Dashboard (Manager View) must be optimized for modern mobile UI/UX, incorporating visual data elements such as charts and metrics to quickly convey key operational metrics. The critical principle governing the dashboard design is prioritization: it must prominently feature Alerts, Violation Summaries, and Overdue Training Tasks to guide managerial attention toward immediate risks and compliance gaps.
2.2. Proprietary Staff Certification ("Sting Certified") Module Design
The "Sting Certified" designation is intended to signify a level of staff preparedness that surpasses baseline state-mandated alcohol service training, integrating detailed operational security and localized risk management protocols.
2.2.1. Curriculum Structure and Core Objectives
The training content must be constructed using modular, engaging formats suitable for mobile consumption, reflecting modern compliance eLearning standards.
 * Module 1: Foundations of Responsible Service: Covers baseline legal responsibilities, standard practices for identifying signs of intoxication, and procedures for preventing sales to minors, aligning with foundational elements of state-required training programs.
 * Module 2: Advanced Conflict Resolution: Dedicated to expert-level techniques for managing difficult customers, professional refusal of service, and executing crowd control protocols, addressing issues common to high-volume alcohol service environments.
 * Module 3: Internal Loss Prevention (The Sting Free Advantage): This is a proprietary module focused explicitly on identifying, preventing, and reporting common staff-based financial scams and fraud, such as "overpouring," "charging a cheaper liquor when a more expensive one is ordered," "not ringing up the drink," and the "slam dunk" technique.
 * Module 4: Regulatory Check Preparedness: Provides specific, guided training on the organization’s policies and procedures for handling compliance checks, municipal audits, and underage decoy operations, ensuring staff uniformity in response.
2.2.2. Assessment and Knowledge Retention Mechanism
The effectiveness of the LMS is measured through completion and pass rates, which are key performance indicators for compliance programs.
To ensure high engagement and knowledge retention, the platform must utilize Micro-Quizzing—scenario-based multiple-choice formats  integrated throughout the learning modules. This approach incorporates a high level of interactivity that data suggests is more memorable than passive training. A rigorous Final Certification Exam must be passed to achieve the "Sting Certified" status.
Critically, the system must include Recertification Triggers. If a staff member is associated with a confirmed high-risk incident or a verified violation (e.g., failing a preventative compliance check scheduled by the business owner), mandatory retraining on relevant modules must be automatically assigned.
By tracking the number and nature of incidents tied to employees who have completed the training , the system establishes a direct causal link between training efficacy and tangible risk reduction. This capability transforms Sting Free from a simple certification provider into a compliance risk mitigation tool, allowing venues to demonstrate quantifiable improvement in operational efficiency and legal liability reduction.
2.2.3. Compliance Tracking and LMS Integration
The managerial interface must furnish comprehensive metrics essential for internal reporting and compliance audits, adhering to established industry practices for LMS systems. The core data tool is the Staff Compliance Matrix, a real-time grid detailing: Staff Name, current Certification Status, Date Certified, Expiration Date, and the Related Incident Count—a direct measure of the number of reported internal or external incidents linked to that staff member. All data, including training records and personal identification information, must be hosted securely utilizing industry-standard cloud-based technology.
III. Functional Requirements: The Real-Time Alert System
This alert system is the product's cornerstone, providing localized intelligence. Given the highly sensitive nature of this feature, its design must prioritize legal defensibility by redefining "real-time" to avoid any implication of obstructing law enforcement activity.
3.1. Incident Reporting Mechanism (Quick Report Form)
The application must offer a mechanism for Staff and Managers to report incidents rapidly and accurately. The user interface for the Quick Report Form must focus on Speed and Accuracy, minimizing the requirement for text entry by utilizing intuitive, categorized buttons (e.g., "Underage Decoy Attempt," "Customer Conflict," "Internal Theft").
Upon submission, the app must automatically capture the device's Geo-Location Stamping via GPS coordinates, ensuring report accuracy, potentially within five meters. This process relies on utilizing the underlying Expo Location services. The form also requires Evidence Submission capability, allowing users to attach photos (e.g., a citation or documentation of a scam).
Incident reports will be categorized by the user into:
 * Regulatory Sting (Verified): Reports confirming a formal regulatory citation or enforcement action has occurred.
 * Unverified Hotspot Report: User-submitted observation of potential high regulatory presence (e.g., undercover vehicles, unusual police activity).
 * Operational Incident: Internal issues such as employee scams, intoxication issues, or customer aggression.
3.2. Real-Time Notification Architecture for Venues
Notifications must be reliable and prioritized for high user engagement. The architecture must be explicitly designed around a core legal mitigation strategy.
3.2.1. Alert Trigger Logic: Legal Mitigation Strategy
The system must unequivocally avoid providing instant warnings regarding active law enforcement operations to prevent legal exposure related to obstruction of justice. The notification mechanism is therefore defined as a means for disseminating localized, aggregated, and verified historical intelligence.
The notification architecture relies on Geofenced, Near-Real-Time Alerts. Alerts are triggered only when a validated incident (Regulatory Sting or confirmed Hotspot) is logged and verified within a pre-defined geofence radius (e.g., 5-mile radius) of a subscribing venue. The data must be confirmed through either the aggregation of multiple, independent user submissions within a short time frame, or by confirmed public record of citations, moving the system away from reliance on single-user input.
The objective is to establish a legally sound causal relationship: Verified Incident Data \rightarrow Geospatial Trend Analysis \rightarrow Preventative Alert \rightarrow Reduced Likelihood of Future Failure. The alert is designed to dictate preventative behavioral changes (e.g., increasing ID checks) based on nearby historical risk trends, not to enable evasion of immediate checks. This repositioning of the product as a system for historical intelligence is essential for viability, especially considering the intense legal scrutiny placed on electronic tools used in proximity to official surveillance and enforcement.
Alert content sent to managers will be concise, stating: "Regulatory Compliance Incident reported at [Nearby Area] on. Review local risk protocols." These alerts must be prominent on the Manager Dashboard.
3.2.2. Push Notification Format and Prioritization
The push notification service must leverage the Expo environment for cross-platform delivery.
 * Manager Notifications: Must be reserved for urgent operational matters, including validated Sting/Hotspot reports, critical staff training deadline reminders, and system alerts.
 * Staff Notifications: Primarily focus on LMS engagement, such as training completion reminders and new module releases.
Technically, the implementation requires the React Native client to register the user's Expo Push Token with the Sting Free serverless backend. The server then calls the Expo Push API when a geofence trigger is activated by a validated incident.
3.3. Sting History Database and Trend Analysis Dashboard
All incident data must be stored and managed within a secure, relational database structure. Given the need to define relationships between Staff, Venues, Training, and Incidents, a managed relational database service (Replit PostgreSQL) is required.
The Incident Log maintains a chronological record of all reports, providing an audit trail. The system’s true intelligence lies in Hotspot Analysis, where centralized data is data-mined to "predict possible hotspots, peak times and other information on the occurrences of incidents". This derived intelligence is the foundation for the predictive geofenced alerts. Managers must be provided with a Visual Trend Mapping dashboard, allowing them to visualize incident density and patterns, which assists in implementing effective preventive strategies.
IV. Non-Functional Requirements and Critical Risk Mitigation
4.1. Data Security and Privacy Requirements
To maintain data integrity and development stability, the application must utilize separate development and production databases within the Replit environment. This isolation is mandatory for safeguarding live operational data during testing cycles. User-submitted reports concerning operational issues (e.g., employee scams) must be handled with care. To encourage high reporting rates and prevent internal retaliation, the data must be aggregated or anonymized before being presented to venue management, aligning with best practices for compliance monitoring.
4.2. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Strategy (Crucial)
The highest product risk lies in potential allegations of obstruction of justice or aiding evasion of regulatory compliance. Mitigating this requires a stringent control system over the alert function.
#### 4.2.1. Mitigating the Risk of Obstruction: Redefining "Real-Time"
The system’s architecture must be implemented to prevent it from functioning as an instantaneous "tip-off" system for active law enforcement or regulatory personnel. This is achieved through the implementation of Server-Side Verification. All user-submitted Regulatory Sting reports must initially enter a PENDING verification status in the database before any broadcast occurs. The immediate, direct warning based on single, unverified user input is prohibited by design.
Legally defensible data sources are paramount. Alerts must rely on aggregated user reports and/or confirmed public records. Furthermore, the system must not engage in any activity that could be construed as active electronic surveillance. In alignment with legal challenges surrounding tools like cell-site simulators (Stingrays), which track location and identity, the Sting Free app must strictly use geofencing to determine venue proximity to documented events (post-incident), not to track or identify law enforcement agents or their assets.
4.2.2. Data Source Verification and Liability Shielding
The core legal safeguard is transparency regarding the data source. The application's Terms of Service (TOS) must explicitly state that Sting Free data reflects user-reported incidents and public records, is intended for historical analysis and staff training purposes, and does not provide warnings regarding active or ongoing law enforcement operations. This structural design, focused on delivering historical intelligence applied geographically, is critical to ensuring the platform's legal viability.
4.3. Performance and Scalability Requirements
The application is required to handle high-volume event data ingestion (incident reports) and rapidly trigger geofenced push notifications to a potentially large network of registered devices. The architecture must leverage Replit's serverless capabilities, utilizing Node.js API endpoints to manage database interactions, token registration, and efficient batch push notification sends.
V. Technical Architecture and Replit Implementation Plan
The entire application infrastructure will be hosted within the Replit ecosystem, adhering to the mandated development environment.
5.1. Core Technology Stack: Replit, React Native, Expo
 * Frontend Development: The cross-platform mobile application will be built using React Native leveraging the Expo framework. Expo provides instant device emulation, manages complex native code requirements (like push notifications and location), and facilitates building hybrid mobile apps or PWAs.
 * Backend/Server: All application logic, including API handling, database interaction, and push notification routing, will be executed via Node.js running as serverless functions on the Replit platform.
 * Deployment: The application will be deployed as a Hybrid Mobile App or PWA via the Expo ecosystem.
5.2. Database Design and Selection
The application’s data requirements—linking staff, training records, venues, and complex, indexed geospatial incident history—necessitate a relational database structure.
5.2.1. Replit Managed PostgreSQL vs. Key-Value Store
 * Core Relational Data: Replit Managed PostgreSQL is the mandatory choice for complex data models, including the LMS records, Staff Compliance Matrix, and the Sting Alert Data Model. PostgreSQL allows for defining tables, enforcing schema integrity, and creating indices essential for high-performance geospatial queries required by the geofencing logic.
 * Ephemeral Data: The Replit Built-in Key-Value Store may be used for simple, non-relational, high-speed read/write data, such as caching configuration settings or managing frequently accessed session tokens.
Table: Sting Alert Data Model (Replit PostgreSQL Schema)
| Field Name | Data Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| alert_id | UUID (Primary Key) | Unique identifier for the reported incident. | Yes |
| alert_category | ENUM | Type of incident (Regulatory Decoy, Internal Incident, User Reported Hotspot)  | Yes |
| venue_id_reported | Foreign Key | ID of the specific venue reporting the incident (links to Venue table). | No |
| geo_latitude | Numeric | Latitude of the reported incident (indexed for geospatial query) | Yes |
| geo_longitude | Numeric | Longitude of the reported incident (indexed for geospatial query) | Yes |
| timestamp_incident | Timestamp | Exact time the incident occurred/was observed. | Yes |
| timestamp_published | Timestamp | Time the validated alert was pushed to the network. | Yes |
| verification_status | ENUM | PENDING, VALIDATED, ARCHIVED (Mandatory status for legal compliance) | Yes |
| reporter_user_id | Foreign Key | ID of the user submitting the report (for internal audit trail) | Yes |
5.3. Backend API Endpoints (Serverless Functions)
The Replit Node.js backend will expose serverless functions via four critical API endpoints:
 * /api/v1/token_register: Handles the POST request to save the device's ExpoPushToken, linking it to a user and venue ID for targeted push notifications.
 * /api/v1/incident_report: Processes the POST request to ingest new Quick Reports, capturing location, category, and evidence. This endpoint initiates the server-side verification queue by setting the verification_status to PENDING.
 * /api/v1/alerts_check: Executes a GET request allowing the Manager Dashboard to pull recent geofenced and validated alerts relevant to their location.
 * /api/v1/training_update: Handles POST requests to update staff progress, quiz scores, and certification status within the LMS PostgreSQL tables.
5.4. Push Notification Implementation via Expo and Backend Service
The notification architecture must leverage the Expo Push Notification Service to manage delivery across iOS and Android devices.
5.4.1. Token Management and Geo-Location Services
 * Token Registration: Upon login, the React Native client uses expo-notifications to secure the ExpoPushToken and transmits this token, along with the user's Venue ID, to the /api/v1/token_register endpoint.
 * Geofencing & Location Permissions: Effective geofencing requires that the app requests both foreground and background location permissions from the user. For iOS, specifically, the Always permission option must be requested using requestBackgroundPermissionsAsync to ensure continuous geofence monitoring and alert capability even when the application is not actively running. This is paramount for the operational intelligence feature.
The technical challenge lies in the efficiency of the alert process: when a validation occurs, the Node.js backend must execute a rapid geospatial query against the PostgreSQL database to identify all registered ExpoPushTokens associated with venues within the relevant radius, and then efficiently batch the request to the Expo Push API.
VI. User Experience Design and Wireframes
The UX design focuses on minimizing friction for staff and maximizing actionable intelligence for managers, adhering to visual patterns that prioritize alerts and dashboards.
6.1. Key User Flows
 * Venue Registration Flow (Manager): Starts with a clear Call-to-Action (CTA), proceeding through mandatory steps: Account Setup, detailed Venue Data Entry (including geofencing radius definition), Payment processing, Staff Invitation, culminating in immediate redirection to the Dashboard.
 * Staff Training Flow: Staff log in, view their "My Certification Status," select the necessary training module, complete the interactive content and micro-quizzes, pass the Final Exam, and receive the visual "Sting Certified" badge display.
 * Critical Incident Reporting Flow (Staff): This flow must be ultra-minimalist and fast. It begins with a prominent Quick CTA on the Home Screen, proceeds to selecting the Incident Category (via visual icons), confirming the automatic GPS location (read-only), allowing optional photo/notes, and finishing with the Submit action.
6.2. Wireframes: Key Screens and Annotations
6.2.1. Venue Dashboard (Manager Alert Feed)

VII. Appendix: Technical Examples and Success Metrics
7.1. Example Code Snippets (React Native/Expo & Replit Database)
The following examples outline the critical component interaction between the Expo mobile client and the Replit Node.js serverless backend, utilizing the recommended database tools.
A. React Native/Expo Push Notification Configuration (Client Side)
This snippet demonstrates the client-side logic required to obtain the unique Expo Push Token and transmit it to the server for registration.
// Function to register the device for push notifications
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import * as Device from 'expo-device';

async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync(venueId) {
  // Ensure the code runs on a physical device or simulator capable of tokens
  if (Device.isDevice) {
    const { status: existingStatus } = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();
    let finalStatus = existingStatus;
    
    // Request permission if not already granted
    if (existingStatus!== 'granted') {
      const { status } = await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync();
      finalStatus = status;
    }
    
    if (finalStatus!== 'granted') {
      console.error('Failed to get push token for push notification.');
      return;
    }
    
    // Obtain the Expo Push Token using the device's credentials
    const token = (await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync()).data;
    console.log('Expo Push Token:', token);
    
    // Send token and venue association to Replit backend API
    await fetch('YOUR_REPLIT_APP_URL/api/v1/token_register', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      // Link the token to the venue and user for targeted alerts
      body: JSON.stringify({ token, venueId }), 
    });
  } else {
    console.warn('Push Notifications registration skipped: Must use physical device.');
  }
}

B. Replit Node.js Backend API Example (Key-Value Store Write)
This example illustrates a basic Node.js Express handler for the /api/v1/token_register endpoint, demonstrating how to save tokens using the @replit/database package. The key-value store is ideal for quick, non-relational storage of these tokens.
// Server-side Node.js endpoint handler (using Express)
const { Database } = require("@replit/database");
const db = new Database(); // Initializes connection to Replit Key-Value Store

// POST /api/v1/token_register 
// Note: While simpler, a production system would use PostgreSQL for full user/venue relations.

app.post('/api/v1/token_register', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { token, venueId } = req.body;
    
    // Store token with a composite key prefix for easy retrieval by venue ID [span_118](start_span)[span_118](end_span)
    const key = `tokens:${venueId}:${token}`;
    
    // The KV store stores the token value
    await db.set(key, token); 
    
    console.log(`Token registered for Venue ${venueId}: ${token}`);
    res.status(200).send({ success: true, message: 'Token successfully registered.' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Token registration failed:', error);
    res.status(500).send({ success: false, message: 'Internal Server Error during registration.' });
  }
});

7.2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Success
KPIs are essential for quantifying the platform’s value and demonstrating its ROI to B2B clients, measuring both compliance effectiveness and operational improvements.
Table: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Sting Free Success
| KPI Category | Metric | Calculation / Definition | Strategic Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adoption & Usage | Venue Activation Rate | Percentage of signed-up venues completing full profile setup (including staff roster). | Product stickiness and initial configuration success |
| Adoption & Usage | Alert Click-Through Rate (CTR) | Percentage of geofenced push notifications opened by managerial staff. | Engagement and perceived value of the intelligence system |
| Compliance Success | Training Pass Rate | Percentage of staff successfully passing the "Sting Certified" module assessments. | Effectiveness and comprehension of the proprietary LMS content |
| Compliance Success | Certification Renewal Rate | Percentage of staff who renew their "Sting Certified" status annually. | Long-term content relevance and sustained compliance focus |
| Operational Impact | Regulatory Incident Reduction Rate | Percentage decrease in confirmed regulatory citations or violations year-over-year post-Sting Free adoption. | Core ROI: Measurable reduction in external legal liability |
| Operational Impact | Internal Incident Reporting Frequency | Average number of internal reports (e.g., employee scam reports) submitted per venue per month. | Indicates cultural shift toward proactive operational security |
VIII. Conclusions and Recommendations
The Sting Free application provides a compelling value proposition by directly addressing the duality of risk facing hospitality operators: external regulatory non-compliance and internal operational loss. The integration of proprietary "Sting Certified" training, explicitly targeting staff scams, alongside a geo-localized intelligence network, creates a powerful risk management tool that exceeds the capabilities of standard industry compliance training systems.
The most critical strategic recommendation is the strict adherence to the defined legal mitigation strategy. By officially defining the "real-time notification" feature as near-real-time intelligence aggregation dependent upon server-side verification and relying on documented events rather than active surveillance, the platform minimizes the catastrophic legal risks associated with obstruction of justice. This legal framework is essential for commercial viability and requires rigorous enforcement within the development lifecycle.
Technically, the project is well-suited to the Replit ecosystem, utilizing Expo/React Native for rapid cross-platform deployment and Replit’s managed PostgreSQL service for the complex relational database requirements of the LMS and geospatial incident history. Success will be validated not just by training completion rates, but by tracking the measurable reduction in confirmed regulatory and internal incidents, proving the application's concrete financial and legal benefits to subscribing venues.
