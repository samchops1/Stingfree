# Understanding Regulatory Sting Operations

## What is a Sting Operation?

A **sting operation** is an undercover law enforcement procedure designed to test compliance with alcohol service regulations. These operations typically involve:

- **Underage Decoy Operations**: Law enforcement uses individuals under 21 to attempt alcohol purchases
- **Over-Service Tests**: Observing if staff continue serving visibly intoxicated customers
- **Hours of Operation Checks**: Verifying compliance with legal service hours
- **License Verification**: Ensuring proper permits are displayed and current

### The Real Cost of Non-Compliance

- **Fines**: $500 - $10,000+ per violation
- **License Suspension**: 30-90 days (or permanent revocation for repeat offenses)
- **Criminal Charges**: Potential misdemeanor charges for staff and management
- **Civil Liability**: Lawsuits from injuries caused by over-service
- **Insurance Impact**: Higher premiums or policy cancellation
- **Reputation Damage**: Loss of customer trust and negative publicity

---

## Your Legal Rights During a Sting

### What You CAN Do:
✅ **Ask for Identification** - Always required, even if the person looks obviously of age
✅ **Refuse Service** - You have the right to refuse any sale if you have doubt
✅ **Request Backup** - Call a manager or coworker for a second opinion
✅ **Document Everything** - Take notes, keep copies of IDs (if permitted by state law)
✅ **Call Law Enforcement** - If you suspect a fake ID or illegal activity

### What You CANNOT Do:
❌ **Destroy Evidence** - Never confiscate or damage IDs
❌ **Detain Individuals** - You're not law enforcement
❌ **Make Accusations Without Proof** - Avoid defamation
❌ **Ignore Warning Signs** - Willful blindness is not a defense

---

## Recognizing a Potential Sting

### Common Indicators:
1. **Young-looking individual** with brand new/pristine ID
2. **Nervousness or rehearsed behavior** when ordering
3. **Lack of familiarity** with typical bar customs
4. **Unusual payment methods** (exact change, no questions about price)
5. **Refusal to show additional ID** when asked
6. **Accompanying adults** who don't order but observe closely

### What to Do If You Suspect a Sting:
1. **Stay Calm** - Act professionally
2. **Follow Standard Procedures** - Verify ID thoroughly
3. **Ask Clarifying Questions** - Date of birth, address, zodiac sign
4. **Use Your Judgment** - When in doubt, refuse service
5. **Document** - Note time, description, ID details
6. **Notify Management** - Report immediately after the interaction

---

## Best Practices for Compliance

### The Three-Step Verification Process:

**STEP 1: VISUAL INSPECTION**
- Look at the person's face and demeanor
- Estimate age (if they look under 30, always check ID)
- Observe behavior (nervousness, coaching from others)

**STEP 2: ID VERIFICATION** (Covered in detail in Module 2)
- Check expiration date
- Verify age calculation (21+ for alcohol)
- Inspect security features
- Compare photo to person

**STEP 3: FINAL JUDGMENT**
- If ANY doubt exists → REFUSE SERVICE
- "When in doubt, card them out"
- A lost sale is better than a lost license

---

## Documentation Requirements

### What to Document:
- Date and time of service refusal
- Physical description of individual
- ID information (type, state, number)
- Reason for refusal
- Witnesses present
- Manager notified

### Why Documentation Matters:
- **Legal Protection**: Proves you followed procedures
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify repeat offenders
- **Training Evidence**: Demonstrates staff competence

---

## Post-Sting Procedures

### If You're Cited:
1. **Stay Professional** - Argue on paper, not in person
2. **Gather Information** - Names, badge numbers, citation details
3. **Preserve Evidence** - Security footage, witness statements, receipts
4. **Contact Legal Counsel** - Immediately, before making any statements
5. **Review Training Records** - Demonstrate compliance efforts
6. **File Incident Report** - Through the Sting Free app

### Protecting Your Venue:
- **Immediate Retraining**: For involved staff
- **Policy Review**: Update procedures if needed
- **Management Briefing**: Alert all managers
- **Legal Strategy**: Work with attorney on response

# ID Verification Mastery

## Why ID Verification Matters

Every year, thousands of hospitality venues face fines, license suspensions, and legal action due to serving underage individuals. **Proper ID verification is your first and most important line of defense.**

### The Statistics:
- **89%** of underage drinking citations involve ID failures
- **$2,500** - Average fine per violation (varies by state)
- **3x** higher insurance costs after a violation
- **60 days** - Average license suspension for first offense

---

## Acceptable Forms of ID

### Primary IDs (Universally Accepted):
✅ **State-Issued Driver's License** (from any U.S. state)
✅ **State-Issued ID Card** (non-driver)
✅ **U.S. Passport** (book or card)
✅ **Military ID** (with photo and DOB)
✅ **Permanent Resident Card** (Green Card)

### Secondary IDs (Check Local Laws):
⚠️ **Foreign Passports** - May be acceptable, verify with management
⚠️ **Tribal IDs** - Accepted in some jurisdictions
⚠️ **Foreign Driver's Licenses** - Generally not recommended

### Never Accept:
❌ School IDs
❌ Photocopies
❌ Digital/Phone Photos of IDs
❌ Expired IDs (unless specified by state law)
❌ Damaged IDs that can't be verified

---

## The 6-Point ID Verification System

### 1. Check the Expiration Date
**Why**: Expired IDs are not valid for age verification in most states
**How**: Look at the expiration date FIRST - before anything else
**Red Flag**: ID expired more than 30 days ago

### 2. Calculate the Age
**Why**: Prevents math errors and ensures legal age
**How**:
- Note today's date
- Calculate: Current Year - Birth Year
- Adjust for birthday (have they had their birthday this year?)
- **Pro Tip**: If birth year is after 2004, they're under 21

**Quick Math Example (2025)**:
- Born 2004 → 21 years old (check if birthday passed)
- Born 2005 → 20 years old (DO NOT SERVE)

### 3. Inspect Security Features

Each state has unique security features. Common ones include:

**Holograms/Overlays**:
- Should be visible from multiple angles
- Look for state seals, repeated patterns
- Tilt the ID to see iridescence

**UV Features**:
- Many IDs have UV-reactive elements
- Use a UV light/blacklight to check
- Look for ghosted images, hidden text

**Microprinting**:
- Tiny text visible only with magnification
- Often in borders, seals, or background
- Fake IDs usually can't replicate this

**Raised Text**:
- Run your finger over dates and signatures
- Should feel embossed/tactile
- Flat printing is a red flag

**Laser Perforation**:
- Tiny holes forming images/text
- Hold up to light to see through
- Difficult for counterfeiters to reproduce

### 4. Compare Photo to Person

**Check:**
- ✓ Face shape and structure
- ✓ Eye color (contact lenses exist, but note differences)
- ✓ Hair color (people dye hair, but consider natural color)
- ✓ Distinguishing marks (moles, scars)
- ✓ Overall appearance

**Red Flags:**
- Different gender from ID
- Significantly different age appearance
- Photo looks like it was digitally altered
- Person's features don't match at all

**Pro Tip**: Ask them to remove glasses/hat if it helps comparison

### 5. Verify Information Consistency

**Ask Verification Questions:**
- "What's your birth date?" (should answer instantly)
- "What's your address?" (check against ID)
- "What's your zodiac sign?" (calculate from birth date)
- "How do you spell your middle name?"

**Red Flags:**
- Hesitation or confusion
- Incorrect answers
- Looking at friends for help
- Nervousness beyond normal

### 6. Physical Inspection

**Look For:**
- Peeling lamination
- Uneven edges or thickness
- Color inconsistencies
- Glue residue
- Blurry printing
- Misaligned text or photos
- Different fonts

**Touch Test:**
- Should feel like professional printing
- Uniform thickness
- Smooth lamination
- Crisp edges

## Common Fake ID Tactics

### 1. **Borrowed ID** (Most Common)
- Using someone else's legitimate ID
- **Detection**: Compare photo carefully, ask questions
- **Risk Level**: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ High (looks real because it is)

### 2. **Altered ID**
- Changing birth date or photo on real ID
- **Detection**: Look for uneven lamination, different fonts
- **Risk Level**: ⚠️⚠️ Medium (visible with inspection)

### 3. **High-Quality Counterfeit**
- Professional fake with security features
- **Detection**: Compare to reference guide, UV test
- **Risk Level**: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ High (sophisticated)

### 4. **Online Novelty IDs**
- Cheap fakes from internet vendors
- **Detection**: Poor quality, missing features
- **Risk Level**: ⚠️ Low (easy to spot)

### 5. **Fake State IDs**
- Fake IDs from states the server is unfamiliar with
- **Detection**: Use reference guide, when in doubt refuse
- **Risk Level**: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ High (unfamiliarity helps fraud)

---

## Handling Suspicious IDs

### DO:
✅ Politely refuse service
✅ Return the ID (don't confiscate)
✅ Offer to call a manager
✅ Document the attempt
✅ Report to law enforcement if you're certain it's fake

### DON'T:
❌ Accuse the person of fraud
❌ Confiscate or damage the ID
❌ Cause a scene
❌ Accept alternative "proof of age"
❌ Cave to pressure or intimidation

### Script:
*"I'm sorry, but I can't accept this ID. I'm not comfortable serving you alcohol based on this identification. I'm happy to get my manager if you'd like to discuss further."*

---

## Technology Tools

### ID Scanning Devices:
**Pros:**
- Fast verification
- Automated age calculation
- Detects many fake IDs
- Creates audit trail

**Cons:**
- Can't catch all fakes
- Borrowed IDs still work
- Technical failures
- Cost

**Best Practice**: Use scanner + visual inspection together

### Mobile ID Verification Apps:
- Can provide state-specific reference guides
- Some have fake ID databases
- Not a replacement for physical inspection

---

## Difficult Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer Gets Angry
**Response**: Stay calm, offer to get manager, don't argue
**Script**: "I understand your frustration, but for my own protection and our license, I need to follow our ID policy."

### Scenario 2: Group Pressure
**Response**: Stand firm, don't let the group intimidate you
**Script**: "I need to verify each person's ID individually. Company policy."

### Scenario 3: Celebrity/VIP
**Response**: Same rules apply to everyone
**Script**: "I'm sure you understand we have to treat everyone equally to protect our license."

### Scenario 4: "I'm a Regular"
**Response**: Regular policy still applies
**Script**: "I know you're a regular, but I still need to see your ID every time. Company policy."

### Scenario 5: ID is Damaged
**Response**: If you can't verify security features, refuse
**Script**: "I can't verify the security features on this ID. Can you provide an alternative form of identification?"

# Internal Loss Prevention & Fraud Detection

## The Hidden Cost of Internal Theft

While sting operations and external compliance are critical, **internal theft represents the largest source of loss** for most hospitality venues.

### The Numbers:
- **75%** of employees have stolen from their employer at least once
- **$50,000+** - Average annual loss per venue to employee theft
- **5-7%** of gross revenue typically lost to internal theft in bars/restaurants
- **Only 15%** of internal theft is discovered and addressed

**This module is your roadmap to protecting your venue from the inside.**

## Common Bartender Scams

### 1. **The "Slam Dunk"** 💰
**How It Works:**
- Bartender serves a well drink or draft beer
- Takes cash payment from customer
- **Does NOT ring it up in the POS system**
- Pockets the cash directly

**Red Flags:**
- High cash tips compared to credit card tips
- Fewer drinks rung up during busy shifts
- Bartender handling cash transactions quickly
- Avoiding the POS during certain orders

**Prevention:**
- **Audit Comparison**: Compare bottle/keg depletion to POS sales
- **Mystery Shoppers**: Use cash and note if it's rung up
- **Camera Coverage**: Monitor register and cash handling
- **Pour Tracking**: Use measured pour spouts
- **Random Audits**: Spot-check drawer vs. POS sales

**Detection Formula:**
```
Expected Sales = (Bottles Used × Ounces per Bottle) ÷ Pour Size
Actual Sales = POS Total Sales for that Spirit
Discrepancy = Expected - Actual
```

If discrepancy is >10%, investigate immediately.

---

### 2. **Overpouring for Tips** 🍸
**How It Works:**
- Bartender deliberately pours extra-large drinks
- Customer notices and tips more
- Venue loses inventory and profit
- Bartender gains larger tips

**Red Flags:**
- Consistent depletion higher than sales
- Customers specifically requesting certain bartenders
- Complaints that other bartenders' drinks are "weak"
- Overly generous pours visible on camera

**Prevention:**
- **Measured Pourers**: Automatic portion control spouts
- **Recipe Cards**: Standardized drink recipes posted
- **Spot Checks**: Manager observes pouring technique
- **Training**: Emphasize cost impact of overpouring

**Cost Impact Example:**
- Standard 1.5 oz pour vs. 2.5 oz pour on a $10 cocktail
- 67% more alcohol used
- Costs venue $3-4 per drink in lost profit
- 50 drinks/shift = $150-200 lost per shift

---

### 3. **The "Upgrade Pocket"** 💵
**How It Works:**
- Customer orders premium liquor (e.g., Grey Goose)
- Bartender rings up well vodka
- Serves the premium brand
- Pockets the price difference

**Red Flags:**
- Premium bottle depletion without corresponding sales
- Bartender has favorite "regulars" who always order premium
- Discrepancies between bottle use and POS category sales

**Prevention:**
- **Separate Premium Tracking**: Count premium bottles daily
- **Posted Prices**: Clear pricing for all tiers
- **Itemized Receipts**: Automatic detailed receipts
- **Random Audits**: Compare bottle counts to sales reports

---

### 4. **The "Void Scam"** 🚫
**How It Works:**
- Ring up customer's order correctly
- Collect payment
- Void or delete the transaction after customer leaves
- Pocket the cash

**Red Flags:**
- High number of voids/deletions
- Voids after cash transactions
- Patterns of voids during specific shifts
- Manager password used suspiciously often

**Prevention:**
- **Manager-Only Voids**: Require supervisor approval
- **Void Reports**: Review all voids daily
- **Audit Trails**: Track who, when, why for each void
- **Security Cameras**: Focus on POS during void transactions

---

### 5. **The "Buy-Back Pocket"** 🎁
**How It Works:**
- Bartender offers "free" drink to regular customer
- Customer tips on the free drink
- Bartender never rings it up
- Pockets the tip + doesn't account for inventory

**Red Flags:**
- Inventory discrepancies on certain shifts
- Bartender has excessive "regulars" who expect free drinks
- Cash tips disproportionate to rung sales

**Prevention:**
- **Comp Tracking**: All comps require manager approval + reason
- **Comp Limits**: Maximum comps per shift per employee
- **Inventory Audits**: Daily bottle/keg counts
- **Policy Enforcement**: Clear comp policy communicated

---

### 6. **Cash Register Manipulation** 💳
**How It Works:**
- Bartender gives incorrect change
- Over-charges customers ("Oh, that'll be $25 not $15")
- Customer doesn't notice
- Bartender pockets the difference

**Red Flags:**
- Customer complaints about bills
- Cash drawer consistently over/under
- Avoiding printed itemized receipts

**Prevention:**
- **Receipt Requirement**: Every transaction gets printed receipt
- **Drawer Counts**: Multiple mid-shift drawer counts
- **Camera Coverage**: Monitor cash handling and register
- **Mystery Shoppers**: Test for overcharging

---

## Server Scams to Watch For

### 1. **The "Walkout Pocket"** 🏃
**How It Works:**
- Server claims customer walked out without paying
- Actually collected payment but reports it as walkout

**Prevention:**
- **Walkout Documentation**: Require incident report + camera review
- **Pattern Analysis**: Track which servers have most walkouts
- **Table Monitoring**: Cameras on exits and tables

---

### 2. **The "Reuse Check" Scam** 📝
**How It Works:**
- Server gives customer handwritten or printed check
- Customer pays cash
- Server reuses the same check for next customer
- Pockets one of the payments

**Prevention:**
- **Unique Check Numbers**: Every check sequentially numbered
- **Digital POS**: Electronic tickets only
- **Audit Checks**: Reconcile check numbers to POS
- **Ban Handwritten Checks**: No exceptions

---

### 3. **The "Dessert/Appetizer Skim"** 🍰
**How It Works:**

- Customer agrees
- Server never enters it in POS
- Kitchen makes it anyway (server orders verbally)
- Server pockets the cash payment

**Prevention:**
- **Kitchen Ticket Required**: No food without POS ticket

- **One Entry/Exit**: Control access points
- **Inventory Tracking**: Daily counts of high-value items
- **Cameras**: Monitor storage areas and exits

---

### 2. **Friend & Family Discounts** 👨‍👩‍👧
**How It Works:**
- Employee gives unauthorized discounts to friends
- Or simply doesn't charge them at all
- Disguises it as comped or voided orders

**Prevention:**
- **Strict Comp Policy**: Written policy on employee discounts
- **Approval Required**: Manager must approve all discounts
- **Track Patterns**: Monitor who gets comps from each employee

---

# Compliance Preparedness & Incident Response

## Pre-Incident Preparation: Building Your Defense

The best time to prepare for a regulatory incident is **before it happens**. Venues that maintain strong compliance programs dramatically reduce both the frequency and severity of citations.

### The Compliance Mindset:
**Reactive** = Scrambling after a citation (expensive, stressful)
**Proactive** = Building systems that prevent citations (cost-effective, sustainable)

---

## Essential Compliance Documentation

### 1. Training Records
**What to Keep:**
- Date each employee completed training
- Training modules completed
- Quiz/test scores
- Recertification dates
- Trainer signatures

**Why It Matters:**
- Demonstrates good-faith effort to comply
- Reduces fines (many jurisdictions offer reductions for trained staff)
- Protects against lawsuits
- Identifies training gaps

**Best Practice:**
✓ Use Sting Free app to automatically track all training
✓ Print quarterly reports for physical backup
✓ Store records for minimum 3 years (check state requirements)

---

### 2. Incident Log
**What to Document:**
- Every service refusal
- Every suspicious ID
- Every intoxicated customer removal
- Every compliance check (sting operation)
- Every customer complaint

**Template Format:**
```
Date/Time: [timestamp]
Employee: [name]
Incident Type: [service refusal/suspicious ID/removal]
Description: [details]
Outcome: [action taken]
Witness: [name]
Manager Notified: [yes/no + name]
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Proves you're actively monitoring compliance

## Building a Culture of Compliance

### Leadership's Role:

**Model Compliance**
- Managers check IDs
- Managers refuse service when needed
- Managers document everything

**Support Staff**
- Back up staff when they refuse service
- Don't pressure staff to make risky choices
- Reward good compliance decisions

**Maintain Standards**
- Don't let standards slip during busy times
- Consistent enforcement of policies
- No "special treatment" for regulars/VIPs

---

### Staff Empowerment:

**"When in Doubt, Refuse"** 🚫
- Employees feel supported saying no
- No punishment for being cautious
- Celebrate good judgment

**Open Communication** 💬
- Staff can report concerns without fear
- Regular team meetings on compliance
- Anonymous feedback mechanisms

**Recognition** 🏆
- Acknowledge great compliance decisions
- Reward employees who prevent incidents
- Share success stories

---

## Advanced Preparation: Mock Stings

### Conducting Internal Test Operations:

**How It Works:**
- Use of-age friend/employee who looks young
- Send them in to attempt purchase without management knowing
- Test if staff properly check ID and refuse if doubtful

**Why It's Valuable:**
- Identifies training gaps
- Tests actual performance under pressure
- Builds staff confidence
- Finds weaknesses before regulators do

**Best Practices:**
- Inform staff that random tests occur (but not when)
- No punishment for failures, only retraining
- Debrief and improve
- Document results

      questionType: "scenario",
      options: [
        "Serve her - the ID shows she's 22",
        "Refuse service - she looks suspicious",
        "Check the ID thoroughly, ask verification questions, and use your judgment",
        "Call the police immediately"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Check the ID thoroughly, ask verification questions, and use your judgment",
      explanation: "Even with a valid-looking ID, nervousness and other red flags warrant extra verification. Ask her birth date, address, or zodiac sign. Thoroughly inspect the ID's security features. If ANY doubt remains after this process, refuse service. This protects you legally while being fair to the customer.",

      questionText: "During a compliance check, an ABC officer asks if you've ever served someone who might have been underage. What is the best response?",
      questionType: "scenario",
      options: [
        "Say 'No, never' to avoid trouble",
        "Explain your ID checking procedures without admitting fault",
        "Refuse to answer any questions",
        "Immediately call your lawyer before answering"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Explain your ID checking procedures without admitting fault",
      explanation: "The best approach is to describe your procedures: 'We check every ID using our 6-point system and refuse service when there's any doubt.' This demonstrates compliance efforts without admitting to violations. Be factual and professional, but don't volunteer admissions or speculate.",

      questionText: "You notice two adults and a young person enter together. The young person orders a beer, and the adults watch closely but don't order anything. What does this suggest?",
      questionType: "scenario",
      options: [
        "Normal behavior - probably family members",
        "Possible sting operation - extra caution is warranted",
        "Suspicious - call police immediately",
        "Nothing unusual - serve the beer if they have ID"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Possible sting operation - extra caution is warranted",
      explanation: "This scenario has multiple sting operation indicators: young person, adults observing closely but not ordering, and the setup nature. While it could be innocent, you should: 1) Check ID extra carefully, 2) Ask verification questions, 3) Inspect all security features, 4) If ANY doubt exists, refuse service. Document the interaction regardless of outcome.",

        "Ignore them and walk away"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Stay calm, restate your decision politely, and get a manager if needed",
      explanation: "Customer pressure should never override safety. Stay professional: 'I understand you're frustrated, but I'm not comfortable serving you based on what I've observed. I'm happy to get my manager.' Document the incident. Your manager will support proper refusals. A lost sale is always better than a lost license.",

        "Just check the birth date and move on"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Inspect more closely for other signs of tampering",
      explanation: "Peeling lamination can indicate tampering (re-lamination after altering details). Inspect further: look for uneven thickness, different fonts, color inconsistencies, or misaligned elements. Check UV features if possible. Compare the photo extra carefully. If additional red flags appear or you have doubt, refuse service. Document your findings.",

      correctAnswer: "No - they're only 20 years old",
      explanation: "Age calculation: 2025 - 2004 = 21 years. BUT their birthday (March 15) hasn't occurred yet (current date is Feb 20). They are still 20 years old. They will turn 21 on March 15. DO NOT SERVE. This is a common mistake - always check if the birthday has passed this year. Pro tip: If someone is born in 2004, they turn 21 sometime in 2025, but you must verify the exact date.",

        "Accept it without checking - passports are always valid"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Birth date, photo comparison, and expiration date",
      explanation: "Foreign passports require the same scrutiny: 1) Calculate age from birth date (they must be 21+), 2) Compare photo to person, 3) Check expiration (some states don't accept expired passports), 4) Look for obvious tampering, 5) If unfamiliar with that country's passport, consult a manager. When in doubt about any foreign ID, refuse service - it's safer than risking a violation.",

      correctAnswer: "Red flag - people know their own birth date instantly",
      explanation: "Hesitation when asked basic information (birth date, address) is a significant red flag. People don't forget their own birthday. This suggests: 1) Borrowed ID (memorizing someone else's info), 2) Fake ID (rehearsed but not internalized), or 3) Nervousness about being caught. Combine this with other factors: Is the photo a good match? Are there physical signs of tampering? When multiple red flags appear, refuse service.",

      ],
      correctAnswer: "Check other security features and make a judgment call",
      explanation: "UV discrepancies are concerning but not always conclusive (older IDs, equipment variation). Conduct additional checks: 1) Inspect holograms, 2) Feel for raised text, 3) Check microprinting, 4) Compare photo, 5) Ask verification questions. If multiple features don't match OR you have lingering doubt, refuse service. Document the ID's state, number, and your findings in case it's a sophisticated fake that regulators should know about.",

      explanation: "Employee theft hurts everyone. Proper response: 1) Note exact time, drinks served, and whether cash was collected, 2) Don't confront the employee (could cause conflict or tip them off), 3) Report to management privately or use anonymous reporting channel, 4) Let management investigate and handle it, 5) Follow your venue's whistleblower protection policy.

      ],
      correctAnswer: "Compare POS sales data to bottle usage to identify discrepancies",
      explanation: "Systematic investigation is key: 1) Compare bottles sold (POS data) to actual depletion, 2) Account for comps, spills, and documented waste, 3) Calculate expected vs. actual variance, 4) Review which shifts show largest discrepancies, 5) Check security footage of storage areas, 6) Only after gathering evidence should you address specific employees.

Investigate by: comparing that bartender's bottle depletion to POS sales, reviewing security footage of pours, conducting mystery shops. High tips + low sales = potential fraud.",

      correctAnswer: "Document the overage, report to a manager, and secure the cash separately",
      explanation: "Cash overages indicate potential issues: 1) Pricing errors (charging too much), 2) Incorrect change (keeping customer's change), 3) Void scams (voiding transactions but keeping cash), 4) Simple math errors. Proper response: note the exact amount, time of discovery, and who has been handling the drawer. Report to management. Investigate with POS reports and potentially camera review.
